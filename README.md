During this project, I analyzed the district-wide standardized test results for a city's school district. Using every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend, I aggregated the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

# PyCitySchools

Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, I created a report that includes the following data: a district summary, a school summary, the highest-performing schools, the lowest-performing schools, math scores by grade, reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size and scores by school type.
